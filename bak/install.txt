CS-Cart Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

The instructions below are about CS-Cart installation on a hosting 
server accessible on the Internet. If you would like to make a CS-Cart 
installation on your local computer (desktop), please download the 
"How to install CS-Cart on a local computer" manual on the "File area"
page in our Customer Help Desk (https://www.cs-cart.com).

Briefly, CS-Cart installation includes the following steps:

1)  extracting the software distribution package and uploading the files 
    to a web server;

2)  setting file access permissions;

3)  creating a MySQL database;

4)  running the Installation Wizard.


1.  The first step is to uncompress the CS-Cart distribution package (the 
    "cscart_vX.X.X.tgz" or "cscart_vX.X.X.zip" file) anywhere under your 
    web server directory.

    On a WINDOWS-based server, you can do it with any TAR- or ZIP-compatible 
    archive software.

    On a UNIX-based server with terminal access to it, please run one of 
    the following commands depending on the package file format:

    tar -xzvf cscart_vX.X.X.tgz
    or
    unzip cscart_vX.X.X.zip

    NOTE: Most versions of control panel have the so-called file manager 
    that allows to unpack a TGZ or ZIP archive by one click.

    If none of the ways above works for you, you should extract the 
    distribution package on your local computer using any TAR- 
    or ZIP-compatible archive software, e.g. WinRAR (you can download it here: 
    http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar370.exe) and upload all the files to your 
    server via FTP.

2.  The next step is setting file access permissions.
    On a UNIX-based server with terminal access to it, run the following 
    commands one by one:

    chmod 666 config.local.php
    chmod -R 777 images
    chmod -R 777 skins
    chmod -R 777 var


    If you do not have terminal access to your server, you can change file
    access permissions using an FTP client. Most of them have the "Change 
    permissions" or "Change mode" functions. With the help of the function 
    you are to set the permissions for the 'config.local.php' file and the 
    directories above. The 'chmod 666 config.local.php' command means that 
    you must set 666 permissions (in other words, read and write permissions 
    for the file user, group and other) for the 'config.local.php' file. Other 
    commands (e.g. 'chmod -R 777 images') mean that you must set 777 (read,
    write and execute) permissions for the directory, its subdirectories and 
    all the files under these directories. Please refer to your FTP client 
    documentation for more detailed instructions on setting file permissions.

    In order to set the same file access permissions on a WINDOWS-based 
    server, you may need to give full permissions for the files and 
    directories to the user with the IUSER_ComputerName account.

3.  Then create a MySQL database (you may need to create a MySQL user before 
    that) in your website control panel. Remember the MySQL name, host, user 
    name and password to use them at the next installation step.

4.  The last major installation step is running the CS-Cart Installation 
    Wizard. In your browser go to the following URL:

    http://www.my_site.com/install/ 
    (replace "my_site.com" with your site's URL).

    Now you should follow the Installation Wizard. The installation progress 
    is shown in the 'Installation steps' box on the left.
